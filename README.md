## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I got a chance to put my knowledge of Flexbox to position platform logos, as well as to change the order in which the form appears on the page.

I added `viewBox` property to the SVG files to make resizing easier.

I also added custom focus styles to the input field and submit button.
